# Real Estate Price Prediction in Bangladesh

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict real estate prices in Bangladesh using machine learning models. The dataset includes property listings with features such as location, floor area, number of bedrooms, and price. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## **Installation**
Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

## **Setting Up the Environment**
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-price-prediction.git
cd real-estate-price-prediction
```

Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## **Usage**

**1. Data Preprocessing**

Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the raw data:
```
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

**2. Feature Engineering**

Generate additional features from the cleaned data:
```
python src/feature_engineering.py
```
**3. Model Training**

Train the machine learning models:
```
python src/model_training.py
```
**4. Model Evaluation**

Evaluate the performance of the trained models:
```
python src/model_evaluation.py
```
**5. Generate the Report**

Use the Jupyter notebook to generate the final report:
```
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf notebooks/06_generate_report.ipynb
```
## **CI/CD Pipeline**

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions. It automatically runs tests, builds the Docker image, and deploys the application to the specified cloud platform whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
